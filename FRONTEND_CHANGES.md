- **Updated UI components** to display room codes and password indicators
- **Added comprehensive error handling** for various join scenarios
- **Fixed TypeScript/ESLint issues** for clean deployment

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/types/index.ts`
**Purpose**: Updated TypeScript interfaces for new chatroom features

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Enhanced Chatroom interface
export interface Chatroom {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  room_code: string;        // NEW - 6-character room code
  has_password: boolean;    // NEW - password protection indicator
  created_by: number;
  created_at: string;
  members: ChatroomMember[];
}

// Enhanced CreateChatroomRequest
export interface CreateChatroomRequest {
  name: string;
  password?: string;        // NEW - optional password field
}

// NEW - Join by room code request
export interface JoinChatroomByCodeRequest {
  room_code: string;
  password?: string;
}
```

### 2. `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
**Purpose**: Updated API service to support new backend endpoints

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Enhanced createChatroom with optional password
createChatroom: (name: string, password?: string) => {
  return api.post('/api/chatrooms', { name, password });
},

// NEW - Join chatroom by room code
joinChatroomByCode: (roomCode: string, password?: string) => {
  return api.post('/api/chatrooms/join', { room_code: roomCode, password });
},
```

### 3. `frontend/src/components/chat/ChatSidebar.tsx`
**Purpose**: Major component enhancement for room code and password functionality

**New State Variables**:
```typescript
const [newChatroomPassword, setNewChatroomPassword] = useState('');
const [roomCode, setRoomCode] = useState('');
const [roomPassword, setRoomPassword] = useState('');
const [showPasswordInput, setShowPasswordInput] = useState(false);
const [isSearching, setIsSearching] = useState(false);
```

**Enhanced Create Chatroom Form**:
- Added optional password input field
- Added helper text explaining password is optional
- Updated form submission to include password parameter

**New Join by Room Code Interface**:
- **Step 1**: Enter 6-character room code with validation
- **Step 2**: Enter password if room is protected
- Smart error handling for different scenarios
- Back navigation between steps

**Enhanced Chatroom Display**:
- Shows room codes in monospace font
- Displays lock icons for password-protected rooms
- Improved layout with better information organization

**New Functions**:
```typescript
// Search for room by code (attempts join to check if password needed)
const searchRoomByCode = async (e: React.FormEvent) => { ... }

// Join room with password after initial search
const joinRoomWithPassword = async (e: React.FormEvent) => { ... }
```

### 4. `frontend/src/app/chat/page.tsx`
**Purpose**: Updated welcome page button text

**Changes**:
- Changed "Join a Chatroom" button text to "Join by Room Code"
- Maintains same functionality but reflects new joining method

## User Experience Flow

### Creating a Room
1. Click "Create New Chatroom"
2. Enter room name (required)
3. Optionally enter password
4. Click "Create Chatroom"
5. Automatically join and navigate to new room
6. Room code is generated and displayed

### Joining a Room
1. Click "Join by Room Code"
2. Enter 6-character room code
3. Click "Find Room"
4. **If no password**: Automatically join room
5. **If password required**: Enter password and click "Join Room"
6. Navigate to joined room

## Error Handling
- **Invalid Room Code**: "Room not found. Please check the room code."
- **Wrong Password**: "Incorrect password. Please try again."
- **Already Member**: "You are already a member of this chatroom."
- **Network Error**: Generic error with retry option

## UI/UX Improvements
- **Lock Icons**: Yellow lock icons for password-protected rooms
- **Room Codes**: Displayed in monospace font for clarity
- **Loading States**: Spinners for searching and joining operations
